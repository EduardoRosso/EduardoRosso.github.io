Gabor Szabo may not have been as much of a household name as his jazz guitar counterparts (Grant Green & Wes Montgomery),but the Hungarian guitarist was a incredibly skilled player that posessed unmatched versatility.After starting his career as a member of the ever evolving Chico Hamilton Quintet in the early 60s,Szabo turned to Indian, Latin and psychedelic rock fusion to craft his jazz recordings as band leader on the adventurous Impulse label.

History is littered with virtual bands. The 60s had The Archies and The Banana Splits, the 70s had The Wombles and everything created by Jonathan King. But by the 21st century the concept was to become far more than a way of marketing pop to kids. Gorillaz is most decidedly a grown-ups' affair. At the point where Blur - bereft of guitarist Graham Coxon - decided to take a break and Damon Albarn was still grieving both band and a long-term relationship, instead of wallowing in a Lennon-esque 'lost weeekend' he took a creative left turn. Sharing a flat with friend and Tank Girl cartoonist, Jamie Hewlett, the pair decided to create their own bunch of reprobate, porno-loving oiks. Mis-Spelling the name with a 'z' in honour of the ultimate cartoon band, The Monkees, Albarn and Hewlett joined forces with San Francisco's hip hop genius, Dan 'The Automator' Nakamura and the band was born. Hewlett created the visual identities of 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel while Albarn added the soundtrack to their cartoon capers.
